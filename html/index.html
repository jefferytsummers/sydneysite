    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Sydney Smith is the most wonderful person you could ever hope to meet. She is brilliant, caring, intuitive, artistic, and gorgeous. I couldn't ask for a better friend and partner.</p>
    <p>Having a degree in philosphy and a degree in physics, Sydney uses her background in both fields to better communicate science in the form of short stories and poems.</p>

            <p>&#x201C The hike down to the waterfall is as slippery and bumpy</p>
            <p> as buttered corn on the cob with a few bites missing.</p>
            <p> A throaty shhhh warns of the bubbly white horizon,</p>
            <p> and audible power seeps into open ears, taking residence</p>
            <p> in the space once occupied by meditations on balance.</p>
            <p> But it is the daytime fireflies who enchant.&#x201D</p>

        &#x201C An electron within the Bohr atomic model finds itself enmeshed in a rigid framework with strict causal properties, as the structure of a waterfall, in its entirety, appears causally-related to gravity alone. However, a quantum mechanical electron exists in a superposition of all possible states, that is, until we measure one of its properties. A single water droplet within the falls has a chaotic path of descent, much unlike the structure of a waterfall perceived in its entirety. The waterfall interacts with its surroundings. When a jutting rock detects a droplet, thereby measuring its location, the rock alters the droplet’s route, sending it spurting out another way until detected by another rock. Hence, outside interaction adds to the chaos of the droplet’s path. Quantum mechanical electrons also possess properties defined by outside interaction: our measurement of them. &#x201D
